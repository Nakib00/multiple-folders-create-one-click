# multiple-folders-create-one-click
This Python script allows you to create multiple folders with specified names in one go.

"I've developed a Python script to automate the creation of folders for my research project. Within this project, I extensively utilize Bangladeshi local words to capture the essence of every decision made. After gathering voice recordings from individuals, I split them into individual words and need to store each word in its own dedicated folder. With a total of 306 unique words, manually creating folders for each one would be time-consuming. Hence, I wrote a script to streamline this process and automatically generate the necessary folders for efficient organization.
